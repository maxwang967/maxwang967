### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¼ I am a P.h.D candidate in **Beijing University of Posts and Telecomunications**, working as a research assistant in the **Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences**.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning and deep learning methods for **intelligent transportation systems**. Iâ€™m generally interested in travel time estimation, traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal data and methods and transporation mode detection. Specially, I'm mainly focusing on data mining techniques for time series data and non-Euclidean structure data (e.g. attention-based methods or graph neural networks etc.).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please feel free to contact me with **max.chenxing.wang (at) gmail.com**, or with my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenxing-wang-678457b3/.
