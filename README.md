Iâ€™m generally interested in travel time estimation, traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal data and methods and transporation mode detection. Specially, I'm mainly focusing on data mining techniques for time series data and non-Euclidean structure data (e.g. attention-based methods or graph neural networks etc.).
